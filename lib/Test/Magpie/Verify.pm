=head1 DESCRIPTION

Spy objects allow you to look inside a mock and verify that certain methods have
been called. You create these objects by using C<verify> from L<Test::Magpie>.

Spy objects do not have a public API as such; they share the same method calls
as the mock object itself. The difference being, a method call now checks that
the method was invoked on the mock at some point in time, and if not, fails a
test.

You may use argument matchers in verifying method calls.
