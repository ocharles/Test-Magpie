=head1 DESCRIPTION

A mock object in stub mode to declare a stubbed method. You generate this by
calling C<when> in L<Test::Magpie> with a mock object.

This object has the same API as the mock object - any method call will start the
creation of a L<Test::Magpie::Stub>, which can be modified to tailor the stub
call. You are probably more interested in that documentation.
